# ENS Subgraph

This Subgraph sources events from the ENS contracts. This includes the ENS Registrar, the Auction Registrar, and any resolvers that are created and linked to domains. The resolvers are added through dynamic data sources. More information on all of this can be found at [The Graph Documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start).
